Welcome!

![](media/5e6c40772f7c2fa2c40a2f0254dba24a.jpg)

I like self-defining names; hence I named this site after the famous slime mold
[Physarum polycephalum](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Physarum_polycephalum). This
species has been shown to [solve
mazes](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159) [and conceptualize metropolitan
transport networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep10794). Tasks, may I
say, many humans cannot perform. Furthermore it does it the upmost
peculiar way; by corporation. Believe it or not the slime mold you see pictured
above consists of numerous single celled organisms. Cells which on their own
seem simple, form together to make a more intelligent whole. You see the analogy
now? Though we are slightly more intelligent than single celled organism we too
can benefit a lot by cooperating. To do that we need a common framework; I call
it Physarum.

What is Physarum exactly?
-------------------------

Physarum consists of two systems: this website and the browser extension
Hypothesis. Let us begin with the website.

### The Website

The website is hosted as a public repository on
[github.com](https://github.com/hf6hshfzjiog/Poly), which means everyone can see
its underlying source code and consequently suggest changes to it. Were you to
be a
[collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/permission-levels-for-a-user-account-repository#collaborator-access-for-a-repository-owned-by-a-user-account)
however, your changes would immediately be enacted.

Then what changes can you make? Great question. The framework this website is
[built upon](https://jekyllrb.com/) is primarily meant to convert markdown files
into HTML. To see how to write and post your own markdown file [Click Me](/docs/tutorials/how-to-post.md).
Additionally one can host PDF Files and link to any filetype as a download.

### Hypothesis

Hypothesis Is a browser extension available for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek),
[Microsoft Edge
Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek)
and [other browsers](https://web.hypothes.is/help/installing-the-bookmarklet/).
It lets you annotate the web and has built in support for PDFs. You'll find the group invites their respective course category.

### The Merger

Together these systems work very nicely together; the website being our home
base on the internet to host our own documents and Hypothesis
gluing it all together.
